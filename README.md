## Weekly exercises  
### Excercise 1 - Prototyping on a highly constrained task
"Step 1: Design a tower that can be built using 13 strands of spaghetti and some tape. The evaluation criteria are height, robustness, and beauty."

#### Sketches
The process began with sketches on paper. I used a notepad and a ruler and did three quick ones presented in image 1.
I focused on triangular shapes as they are structurally most rigid, which is important for such fragile material.

*Three tower sketches*

As an engineer I would mostly focus on the height and robustness -- beauty is a secondary value in engineering.
I marked out the bill of materials on the sketches by counting the spaghetti strands.
Tape joints were drawn as circles. My favourite of the three is the bottom one, since it is asymmetric and most simplistic.
Both are design values I like.
It would be my plan for the implementation.

#### Implementation
As I began to build the tower, it occurred to me that I can save a quite a lot of material if I tape the tower directly to the table.
This would render the bottom triangle useless and simplify the building process.
As engineering work is a lot about saving resources, I thouht my plan was genious.

After the base triangle was done, went on to raising the height of the building. For the middle part I taped two spaghetti strands together for rigidity and taped a single one on top of them. Then I just stuck the antenna on top of the base and to my surprise it held together.
Finally, for aesthetics, I slid one strand inside the middle of the base triangle. Unlike in the sketch, the tower became symmetrical. Or at least tries to be.
The exercise taught me that plans can and (sometimes) should change in the implementation process. However, maybe this advice is not always applicable -- do not change the plans in production.

My creation is called "The cheap tower" as it is built only of seven strands of spaghetti. Image 2 shows the finished tower in its full height of 73 cm.

### Excercise 2
### Concept generation: Latent functions method 
This week the first task was to *1. Make a list of new uses of clothes pegs*:
My list is shown in Image 3:

![Image 3](ex2/conception.jpg)

In retrospective, my list was quite focused on the functional side of things and repurposing the functionality of the product.
I did not focus on repurposing the materials nor on the aesthetic or artistic purposes. 

Also in the image are the results of the second task: *2. Focusing on those uses, think of a new concept of a product
(sketch & annotate)*.
I focused on the cable management solution. I sketched the basic idea and a redesigned a "cable peg" which has flatter inner sides and a nail to attach it more securely to the table.

The second part of the exercise was *II. Mindmapping method Create a mind map of the topic: Mosquitos*.
My mindmap is shown in image 4.

![Image 4](ex2/mindmap.jpg)
*Mindmap of mosquitoes*

I am happy how the mindmap turned out.
As can be observed, I tried to sketch the mindmap in the shape of a mosquito with different body parts representing different subtopics.
The exercise had no strict rules on which things on mosquitoes to focus on, so I focused mainly on body parts and their functions. I tried to be not too serious about it.

The final part was to create a compound map of the same topic -- I could not figure out what a compound map is and that is why I skipped this task.

See you next week!

### Excercise 3

The plan of the exercise was to sketch and design iteratively. Furthermore, human oriented design was also the topic.

 The exercise was quite long and repetitive, and did not make sense in some parts.
Concentrating on the wallet topic was quite restrictive.
Or I am just too simple to understand its goals.

The results, analysis and reflection of the exercise are shown below:

#### Tasks 1 & 2: *Design something useful and meaningful for your teammate. Start by gaining empathy.*

![Image 5](ex3/part1.jpg)
*Tasks 1 and 2*

It came apparent quite quickly that the partner alreay pretty much had their ideal wallet.
Only thing missing was durability, which is hard in prototyping -- it would have to be imagined.

#### Tasks 3-6: *Reframe the problem, Ideate: generate alternatives to test. Sketch at least 5 radical ways to meet your user's needs.*

![Image 6](ex3/part2.jpg)
*Tasks from 3 to 6*

The feedback for the five radical solutions is written beside the ideas with a thicker pen.

#### Tasks 7-9: *Iterate based on feedback, sketch, build and test, share and get feedback.*

![Image 7](ex3/part3.jpg)
*Tasks from 7 to 9*

### Excercise 4

The individual exercise this week focused on two design methods: SCAMPER and morphological analysis:

#### SCAMPER
The task: *Applying the corresponding methodology, develop as many ideas as possible regarding novel creative concepts for a SMALL RECYCLING STATION*

I though the recycling station concept was quite broad. What even is a *small* recycling station? And what is a *recycling station*? First thing to pop into mind is the basic sorting bins found in kitchen cabinets. But I expanded the idea and designed it completely from scratch seven times. It was quite fun actually and I believe I was being quite quirky and creative. Some ideas are crazy, cartoonish and not feasible at all.
See my results from the images below:

![Image 13](ex4/s6.jpg)

![Image 14](ex4/s7.jpg)


#### Morphological analysis

Getting the hang of this method took a while. After that, I liked more than the SCAMPER method -- it is faster and more visualizing. And matrices are effective.
See results below:

![Image 15](ex4/m.jpg)

#### Group exercise

The exercise 4 included a group session to design the same things with the same methods as individually. We did it in groups of three. I think I got more creative results when doing the exercise on my own, but the group brought some new ideas as well. We had most of the issues when selecting items from the morphological analysis chart. We could not decide on which items to choose.

### Excercise 5

#### Fishbone diagram method
The task was to design a device for improving mobility of low-income persons. The method was the fishbone diagram method.
In my opinion, the method is quite similar to mindmapping, but makes the idea somehow more vague while still increasing complexity.
Not to my liking then.
However, see my fishbone diagram here:
![Image 16](ex5/5a1.jpg)

Using the diagram, I conceived a device shown in the following image:

![Image 17](ex5/5a2.jpg)

#### Thematic relations method

Thematic relations is a method where relations between words are (unnaturally) invented.
The given words were *car*, *umbrella* and *spring*.
The forced nature of the method made me invent this crazy product shown in the next image:
![Image 18](ex5/5b1.jpg)

The rest of the tasks and solutions here:
![Image 19](ex5/5b2.jpg)

![Image 20](ex5/5b3.jpg)

![Image 21](ex5/5b4.jpg)

Maybe if a problem was given and the keywords would be related to it, the method would produce more sensible results.
Now creating products just based on keywords makes little sense.

### Excercise 6

#### Collaborative sketching
The sixth exercise focused on the collaborative sketching method.
In teams of three, each team member was given the same problem to work on and a sketch paper of their own.
Initially, each member innovate and sketch their thoughts on the problem and then the sketches are circulated in the team.
Each member then adds their own ideas to the sketches of other members.
No communication is allowed during the process.

My ideas of transportation methods on a snowy moutain:

![Image 22](ex6/6a1.jpg)

I found this method to be quite effective, so here are the benefits:
- people are not affected by other's ideas
- flaws or inadequacies in other's ideas can be seen immediately

disadvantages of method:
- produces some overlapping or similar ideas --> people work on the same thing without knowing

After each sketch had been reviewed and augmented by others, each team member then sketched a favourite one among the creations.
Here's my refinement of ideas:

![Image 23](ex6/6a2.jpg)

#### Pick a mood 

After the ideas were refined and sketched, all the people in the exercise group reviewed other's creations and rated them.
The rating concerned novelty and usefulness and was done using a mood chart. I'd prefer adding numerical values to each emotion for easier quantification.

My moods in the images below:

### Excercise 7

This week's task was to use morphological analysis in groups of 2-3.
The design task was to create a vessel for an egg that's dropped onto floor and prevent the breakage of the egg.
Construction materials to be used were only simple household items.

See our morphological analysis in the following image:

![Image 27](ex7/morphological analysis.png)

The design method was a good fit for the task of constrained design.
Probably also because the method was already familiar.

I chose to implement the simplest solution by wrapping the egg loose into plastic wrap.
The plastic wrap ball was then inserted on top of an empty milk carton. See the next image.

## Individual project

The idea for the project originated from a real problem I wanted to solve. I have a headlamp that I wanted to wear while mountain biking.
However, the lamp could not be attached to the helmet without using hacks such as tape or zip ties that could damage the helmet.

The solution was to design a product/adapter for these to marry these two items shown in the following images:

![Image 29](project/helmet.jpg)
*Lazer Impala helmet*

![Image 30](project/headlamp.jpg)
*Nitecore HC60 headlamp*

Luckily the helmet came with an action camera mount adapter (shown in the image of the helmet), which would act as an interface for the product to be designed.

I made a list of the product requirements:
- Sturdy enough to withstand the stresses of mountain biking
- Subtle to not look like a hack
- Adjustable light beam angle
- Easy to remove the headlight when it's not needed there anymore (in the spring).

I have previous experience of 3D modeling and 3D printing, so I decided to implement the product using those skills.

First I disassembled the headlight to see which parts I need and what I don't.
The lamp has a structure of a pipe with two threaded end caps. This feature could be utilized in the mounting of light to the product.
See the following image for the disassembled lamp.

![Image 31](project/disassembled.jpg)

After listing the components and requirement, I had the framework of the problem. Based on that, I made a sketch of the product:

![Image 32](project/sketch.jpg)

Based on the sketch, I started to design the part in FreeCAD, which I am familiar with.

Since the helmet provided a mounting interface, for a camera, creating a matching lamp bracket was as easy as measuring the parts with a caliper.
Creating a sturdy platform for the light was more tricky -- I decided to simplify the design by removing the other upper bracket from the sketch.
The lamp would slide through the bracket with the end cap unscrewed. The cap would then be screwed back on.
On the other end, I created a slot for a zip tie to hold the light better in place.

The design process was quite straightforward and interesting, since the product has an actual real life use case.
Furthermore, the design process clarified the actual steps of designing a product like this.
These methods apply to abstract products such as software as well.

Here's a screenshot of the 3D model:

![Image 33](project/3dmodel.png)

A simple M5 screw is used to attach the product to the helmet.

The next step was to bring the creation to life by printing it.
I used a fused deposition modeling (FDM) printer with PLA plastic as the material.

Finally, the finished product was attached to the lamp and the helmet.

![Image 34](project/finished.jpg)
*Finished product.*

Turns out the fit is so exact that the lamp is held sturdily in place even without the zip tie. The beam height adjustment works.
I think the design came out even better than expected.
To finish this off, it should be printed again using black filament, but the white is better for demonstration purposes.
