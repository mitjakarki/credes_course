## Weekly exercises  
### Excercise 1 - Prototyping on a highly constrained task
"Step 1: Design a tower that can be built using 13 strands of spaghetti and some tape. The evaluation criteria are height, robustness, and beauty."

#### Sketches
The process began with sketches on paper. I used a notepad and a ruler and did three quick ones presented in image 1.
I focused on triangular shapes as they are structurally most rigid, which is important for such fragile material.

*Three tower sketches*

As an engineer I would mostly focus on the height and robustness -- beauty is a secondary value in engineering.
I marked out the bill of materials on the sketches by counting the spaghetti strands.
Tape joints were drawn as circles. My favourite of the three is the bottom one, since it is asymmetric and most simplistic.
Both are design values I like.
It would be my plan for the implementation.

#### Implementation
As I began to build the tower, it occurred to me that I can save a quite a lot of material if I tape the tower directly to the table.
This would render the bottom triangle useless and simplify the building process.
As engineering work is a lot about saving resources, I thouht my plan was genious.

After the base triangle was done, went on to raising the height of the building. For the middle part I taped two spaghetti strands together for rigidity and taped a single one on top of them. Then I just stuck the antenna on top of the base and to my surprise it held together.
Finally, for aesthetics, I slid one strand inside the middle of the base triangle. Unlike in the sketch, the tower became symmetrical. Or at least tries to be.
The exercise taught me that plans can and (sometimes) should change in the implementation process. However, maybe this advice is not always applicable -- do not change the plans in production.

My creation is called "The cheap tower" as it is built only of seven strands of spaghetti. Image 2 shows the finished tower in its full height of 73 cm.

### Excercise 2
### Concept generation: Latent functions method 
This week the first task was to *1. Make a list of new uses of clothes pegs*:
My list is shown in Image 3:

In retrospective, my list was quite focused on the functional side of things and repurposing the functionality of the product.
I did not focus on repurposing the materials nor on the aesthetic or artistic purposes. 

Also in the image are the results of the second task: *2. Focusing on those uses, think of a new concept of a product
(sketch & annotate)*.
I focused on the cable management solution. I sketched the basic idea and a redesigned a "cable peg" which has flatter inner sides and a nail to attach it more securely to the table.

The second part of the exercise was *II. Mindmapping method Create a mind map of the topic: Mosquitos*.
My mindmap is shown in image 4.

*Mindmap of mosquitoes*

I am happy how the mindmap turned out.
As can be observed, I tried to sketch the mindmap in the shape of a mosquito with different body parts representing different subtopics.
The exercise had no strict rules on which things on mosquitoes to focus on, so I focused mainly on body parts and their functions. I tried to be not too serious about it.

The final part was to create a compound map of the same topic -- I could not figure out what a compound map is and that is why I skipped this task.

See you next week!
