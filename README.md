## Weekly exercises  
### Excercise 1 - Prototyping on a highly constrained task
"Step 1: Design a tower that can be built using 13 strands of spaghetti and some tape. The evaluation criteria are height, robustness, and beauty."

#### Sketches
The process began with sketches on paper. I used a notepad and a ruler and did three quick ones presented in image 1.
I focused on triangular shapes as they are structurally most rigid, which is important for such fragile material.

*Three tower sketches*

As an engineer I would mostly focus on the height and robustness -- beauty is a secondary value in engineering.
I marked out the bill of materials on the sketches by counting the spaghetti strands.
Tape joints were drawn as circles. My favourite of the three is the bottom one, since it is asymmetric and most simplistic.
Both are design values I like.
It would be my plan for the implementation.

#### Implementation
As I began to build the tower, it occurred to me that I can save a quite a lot of material if I tape the tower directly to the table.
This would render the bottom triangle useless and simplify the building process.
As engineering work is a lot about saving resources, I thouht my plan was genious.

After the base triangle was done, went on to raising the height of the building. For the middle part I taped two spaghetti strands together for rigidity and taped a single one on top of them. Then I just stuck the antenna on top of the base and to my surprise it held together.
Finally, for aesthetics, I slid one strand inside the middle of the base triangle. Unlike in the sketch, the tower became symmetrical. Or at least tries to be.
The exercise taught me that plans can and (sometimes) should change in the implementation process. However, maybe this advice is not always applicable -- do not change the plans in production.

My creation is called "The cheap tower" as it is built only of seven strands of spaghetti. Image 2 shows the finished tower in its full height of 73 cm.

### Excercise 2
### Concept generation: Latent functions method 
This week the first task was to *1. Make a list of new uses of clothes pegs*:
My list is shown in Image 3:

![Image 3](ex2/conception.jpg)

In retrospective, my list was quite focused on the functional side of things and repurposing the functionality of the product.
I did not focus on repurposing the materials nor on the aesthetic or artistic purposes. 

Also in the image are the results of the second task: *2. Focusing on those uses, think of a new concept of a product
(sketch & annotate)*.
I focused on the cable management solution. I sketched the basic idea and a redesigned a "cable peg" which has flatter inner sides and a nail to attach it more securely to the table.

The second part of the exercise was *II. Mindmapping method Create a mind map of the topic: Mosquitos*.
My mindmap is shown in image 4.

*Mindmap of mosquitoes*

I am happy how the mindmap turned out.
As can be observed, I tried to sketch the mindmap in the shape of a mosquito with different body parts representing different subtopics.
The exercise had no strict rules on which things on mosquitoes to focus on, so I focused mainly on body parts and their functions. I tried to be not too serious about it.

The final part was to create a compound map of the same topic -- I could not figure out what a compound map is and that is why I skipped this task.

See you next week!

### Excercise 3

The plan of the exercise was to sketch and design iteratively. Furthermore, human oriented design was also the topic.

 The exercise was quite long and repetitive, and did not make sense in some parts.
Concentrating on the wallet topic was quite restrictive.
Or I am just too simple to understand its goals.

The results, analysis and reflection of the exercise are shown below:

#### Tasks 1 & 2: *Design something useful and meaningful for your teammate. Start by gaining empathy.*

![Image 5](ex3/part1.jpg)
*Tasks 1 and 2*

It came apparent quite quickly that the partner alreay pretty much had their ideal wallet.
Only thing missing was durability, which is hard in prototyping -- it would have to be imagined.

#### Tasks 3-6: *Reframe the problem, Ideate: generate alternatives to test. Sketch at least 5 radical ways to meet your user's needs.*

![Image 6](ex3/part2.jpg)
*Tasks from 3 to 6*

The feedback for the five radical solutions is written beside the ideas with a thicker pen.

#### Tasks 7-9: *Iterate based on feedback, sketch, build and test, share and get feedback.*

*Tasks from 7 to 9*

### Excercise 4

The individual exercise this week focused on two design methods: SCAMPER and morphological analysis:

#### SCAMPER
The task: *Applying the corresponding methodology, develop as many ideas as possible regarding novel creative concepts for a SMALL RECYCLING STATION*

I though the recycling station concept was quite broad. What even is a *small* recycling station? And what is a *recycling station*? First thing to pop into mind is the basic sorting bins found in kitchen cabinets. But I expanded the idea and designed it completely from scratch seven times. It was quite fun actually and I believe I was being quite quirky and creative. Some ideas are crazy, cartoonish and not feasible at all.
See my results from the images below:

#### Morphological analysis

Getting the hang of this method took a while. After that, I liked more than the SCAMPER method -- it is faster and more visualizing. And matrices are effective.
See results below:

#### Group exercise

The exercise 4 included a group session to design the same things with the same methods as individually. We did it in groups of three. I think I got more creative results when doing the exercise on my own, but the group brought some new ideas as well. We had most of the issues when selecting items from the morphological analysis chart. We could not decide on which items to choose.
